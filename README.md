# Task 7: Browser Extension Security Audit

## Objective
To identify and remove suspicious or unnecessary browser extensions to improve browser security and performance.

## Step 1: Audit
I opened the Chrome Web Store extension manager to review installed extensions.
* **Browser Used:** Google Chrome
* **Total Extensions Found:** 2

### Findings:
1.  **Google Docs Offline:** Official Google extension. Deemed safe.
2.  **McAfee® WebAdvisor:** A security extension. While legitimate, I identified it as "unnecessary" because Chrome has built-in security features, and third-party toolbars can sometimes impact browser performance.



## Step 2: Action Taken
I decided to remove **McAfee® WebAdvisor** to reduce browser bloat and rely on native browser security features.

* **Action:** Clicked "Remove" in the extension manager.
* **Outcome:** The extension was successfully uninstalled.

## Step 3: Conclusion
By auditing my extensions, I ensured that no malicious tools were running. I removed one unnecessary extension to minimize the attack surface and potential tracking.

### Research on "Sandboxing"
* **Concept:** Extension sandboxing is a security mechanism that runs extensions in an isolated environment. This prevents them from accessing critical system files or interfering with other tabs unless explicitly granted permission.
